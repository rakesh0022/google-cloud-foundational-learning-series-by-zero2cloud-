## 🧠 Key Concepts Explained

### **1️⃣ Why People Fail Cloud Interviews**
Most learners only watch tutorials, memorize definitions, or even pass certifications —  
but **cannot deploy a VM, attach a disk, or configure firewall rules in real life**.  
Interviews test **practical ability**, not bookish knowledge.

### **2️⃣ Learn GCP the Right Way**
To succeed, you must:*  
✔ Build things  
✔ Break things  
✔ Fix things  
✔ Repeat*

Hands-on > theory.

### **3️⃣ Your Cloud Learning Roadmap (The Core 7 Topics)**  
From the PPT :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}, here are the foundational pillars:

- **Compute Engine (VMs)**
- **VPC & Networking**
- **Cloud Storage**
- **Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)**
- **Cloud Run**
- **IAM & Security**
- **Monitoring & Logging**

These are essential for any GCP role — from beginner to professional.
